  - Disable the support for ICMP timestamp on the remote host completely

  - Protect the remote host by a firewall, and block ICMP packets passing through the firewall in
  either direction (either completely or only for untrusted networks)","","The Timestamp Reply is an ICMP message which replies to a
  Timestamp message. It consists of the originating timestamp sent by the sender of the Timestamp as
  well as a receive timestamp and a transmit timestamp.","Sends an ICMP Timestamp (Type 13) request and checks if a
