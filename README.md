# Task-3

# 🔍 Basic Vulnerability Scan on Local PC

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform a `basic vulnerability assessment` on a personal computer using `free vulnerability scanning tools` like `OpenVAS Community Edition` or `Nessus Essentials`.  
The objective is to identify `common security issues`, understand their severity, and learn about potential mitigations.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Learn how to use industry-standard vulnerability scanners.
- Identify vulnerabilities on your local system.
- Understand the severity of vulnerabilities and possible fixes.
- Gain introductory experience in **vulnerability management**.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- [OpenVAS Community Edition]** – Open-source vulnerability scanning tool.
- [Nessus Essentials]** – Free version of Nessus vulnerability scanner.

---

## 📋 Steps Performed
1. `Installed the Scanner`
   - Installed OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials on Kali Linux / Windows.
2. `Configured the Scan`
   - Set scan target as:
     - `localhost`
     - or local IP address of the machine.
3. `Executed the Scan`
   - Ran a `Full Vulnerability Scan`.
   - Duration: ~30–60 minutes.
4. `Reviewed the Report`
   - Identified vulnerabilities and their severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
5. `Researched Mitigations`
   - Looked up recommended fixes for high/critical vulnerabilities.
6. `Documented Findings`
   - Saved the scan report and key screenshots.
